**Amplify - Music Player App**

This application does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or user data.  
All audio files accessed through the app remain on the user's local system and are not uploaded or shared externally in any way.

The app uses the JavaFX `FileChooser` component to allow users to select media files, and JavaFX `MediaPlayer` to play those files. These features require access to local file paths, but no data is collected or transmitted.

**Contact:** If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the developer through the GitHub repository.
